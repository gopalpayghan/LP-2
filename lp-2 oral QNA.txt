Below is a concise and structured response to your questions, addressing each one systematically. For clarity, I’ve grouped related topics where appropriate and kept explanations brief while ensuring key details are covered.

### 1. What is DFS and BFS?
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Uses a stack (explicit or via recursion).
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level. Uses a queue.

---

### 2. What is a recursive algorithm?
A recursive algorithm solves a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems of the same type, calling itself with modified inputs until a base case is reached, which provides a direct solution.

---

### 3. Explain DFS and BFS with an example.
- **Example Graph**:
  ```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   /     \
  D       E
  ```
- **DFS**:
  - Start at A, explore B, then D (deepest first). Backtrack to B, then A, then C, then E.
  - Order: A → B → D → C → E.
  - Uses recursion or stack to dive deep and backtrack.
- **BFS**:
  - Start at A, explore B and C (same level). Then explore D and E (next level).
  - Order: A → B → C → D → E.
  - Uses a queue to process nodes level by level.

### 4. Explain A* algorithm.
A* is a heuristic-based search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a weighted graph. It combines the cost to reach a node (actual cost, g(n)) with an estimated cost to the goal (heuristic, h(n)), prioritizing nodes with the lowest total estimated cost (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)).

---

### 5. Formula of A*?
The A* algorithm uses:
```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```
- **f(n)**: Total estimated cost of the cheapest path through node n.
- **g(n)**: Cost from the start node to node n.
- **h(n)**: Heuristic estimate of the cost from node n to the goal.

---

### 6. What is a heuristic function?
A heuristic function, h(n), estimates the cost from a node n to the goal in a search algorithm like A*. It guides the search by prioritizing promising paths. For A* to be optimal, h(n) must be admissible (never overestimate the true cost) and consistent.

---

### 7. What is a greedy search algorithm?
Greedy search (or Greedy Best-First Search) is a search algorithm that selects the node closest to the goal based solely on a heuristic function h(n), ignoring the cost to reach the node (g(n)). It’s fast but not guaranteed to find the optimal path.

---

### 8. Use of minimal spanning tree algorithm?
A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithm (e.g., Kruskal’s or Prim’s) finds a subset of edges in a weighted, connected graph that connects all vertices with minimum total edge weight, without forming cycles. Uses include:
- Network design (e.g., minimizing cable length in telecom).
- Clustering in data analysis.
- Approximating solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

### 9. Explain N-Queen problem with example.
The N-Queen problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).
- **Example (4-Queen)**:
  - Board: 4×4.
  - Solution: Place queens at positions (2,1), (4,2), (1,3), (3,4).
  - Visual:
    ```
    . Q . .
    . . . Q
    Q . . .
    . . Q .
    ```
  - No queens attack each other.

### 10. Explain backtracking process.
Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that incrementally builds solutions and abandons partial solutions (backtracks) when they cannot lead to a valid solution. Steps:
1. Choose a candidate (e.g., place a queen).
2. Check if it’s valid.
3. If valid, proceed to the next step (recursively).
4. If invalid, undo the choice (backtrack) and try another.
- Example: In N-Queen, place a queen, check conflicts, proceed or backtrack.

### 12. Explain DES algorithm.
**DES (Data Encryption Standard)** is a symmetric key block cipher that encrypts 64-bit data blocks using a 56-bit key (plus 8 parity bits). It uses 16 rounds of substitution and permutation (Feistel network) to secure data. Now considered weak due to short key length.

---

### 13. Explain AES algorithm.
**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is a symmetric key block cipher that encrypts data in 128-bit blocks using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It operates through 10–14 rounds of substitution, permutation, and mixing, offering stronger security than DES.

### 15. Explain RSA algorithm.
**RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** is an asymmetric key cryptography algorithm. It uses:
- A public key (n, e) for encryption.
- A private key (n, d) for decryption.
- Based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers (n = p × q, where p, q are large primes).
- Encryption: C = M^e mod n (M is plaintext).
- Decryption: M = C^d mod n (C is ciphertext).

### 16. Explain Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
**Diffie-Hellman (DH)** is a key exchange algorithm that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. It relies on modular exponentiation:
- Public: Prime p, generator g.
- Each party picks a private key (a, b), computes public keys (g^a mod p, g^b mod p), and exchanges them.
- Shared secret: (g^b mod p)^a = (g^a mod p)^b = g^(ab) mod p.

### 17. Explain MD5 algorithm.
**MD5 (Message Digest 5)** is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash from input data. It processes data in 512-bit blocks, using bitwise operations and modular addition. MD5 is fast but insecure for cryptographic use due to collision vulnerabilities.
